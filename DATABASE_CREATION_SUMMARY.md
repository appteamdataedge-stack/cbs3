## Money Market Business Logic Implemented

### Account Structure
- **Account Numbers**: Follow GL hierarchy (e.g., 110101001001)
- **Product Hierarchy**: Product → Sub-Product → GL Code → Account
- **Branch Codes**: BR001, BR002, BR003
- **Tenors**: 1 day (Overnight), 7 days (Weekly), 30 days (Monthly)

### Transaction Logic
- **Debit/Credit Classification**: Loans are Debit, Deposits are Credit
- **Pointing IDs**: Used for transaction linking
- **UDF1 Fields**: Customer type classification (INDIVIDUAL, CORPORATE, INTERBANK)
- **Narration**: Descriptive transaction purposes

### Verification Workflow
- **Maker-Checker**: All entries have Maker_Id, some have Verifier_Id
- **Status Management**: Entry → Posted → Verified
- **Timestamps**: Both entry and verification times recorded
