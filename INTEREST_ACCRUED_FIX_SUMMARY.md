# Interest Accrued Display Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** Account detail page (e.g., `/accounts/100000002001`) shows `Interest Accrued = 0` even though the database `acct_bal_accrual` table has a value in the `Closing_Bal` column.

**Impact:** Users cannot see accumulated interest on their accounts, leading to confusion and potential reporting issues.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original Implementation Issue

The `BalanceService.getLatestInterestAccrued()` method was using:

```java
List<AcctBalAccrual> accruals = acctBalAccrualRepository.findByAccountAccountNo(accountNo);
```

This method relies on JPA's `@ManyToOne` relationship:

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "Account_No", nullable = false)
private CustAcctMaster account;
```

**Problem:** The relationship-based query could fail if:
1. The JPA relationship wasn't properly loaded (lazy loading issue)
2. The join between `Acct_Bal_Accrual` and `Cust_Acct_Master` had issues
3. The foreign key relationship wasn't properly established
4. Hibernate session management issues

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Native SQL Query Method

**File:** `AcctBalAccrualRepository.java`

Added a new method that queries directly on the `Account_No` column without using JPA relationships:

```java
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual WHERE Account_No = ?1 AND Tran_date IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Tran_date DESC LIMIT 1",
    nativeQuery = true
)
Optional<AcctBalAccrual> findLatestByAccountNo(String accountNo);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Bypasses JPA relationship complexity
- ✅ Queries database directly
- ✅ Returns most recent record by `Tran_date`
- ✅ Filters out records with NULL `Tran_date`
- ✅ More reliable and predictable

### 2. Updated BalanceService

**File:** `BalanceService.java`

**Changes:**
1. Added `Optional` import
2. Modified `getLatestInterestAccrued()` to use the new native query method
3. Enhanced logging for better debugging

**New Implementation:**

```java
private BigDecimal getLatestInterestAccrued(String accountNo) {
    log.debug("Fetching latest interest accrued for account: {}", accountNo);
    
    // Use native query method to directly query by Account_No column
    Optional<AcctBalAccrual> latestAccrualOpt = acctBalAccrualRepository.findLatestByAccountNo(accountNo);
    
    if (latestAccrualOpt.isEmpty()) {
        log.info("No interest accrual records found for account {} (with non-null Tran_date)", accountNo);
        return BigDecimal.ZERO;
    }

    AcctBalAccrual latestAccrual = latestAccrualOpt.get();
    BigDecimal closingBal = latestAccrual.getClosingBal();
    
    if (closingBal == null) {
        log.warn("Latest interest accrual record for account {} has null closing balance (Tran_date: {})", 
                accountNo, latestAccrual.getTranDate());
        return BigDecimal.ZERO;
    }

    log.info("Latest interest accrued for account {}: {} (from Tran_date: {}, Accrual_Date: {})",
            accountNo, closingBal, latestAccrual.getTranDate(), latestAccrual.getAccrualDate());

    return closingBal;
}
```

## Files Modified

### Backend (2 files)

1. **`moneymarket/src/main/java/com/example/moneymarket/repository/AcctBalAccrualRepository.java`**
   - Added `findLatestByAccountNo()` native query method

2. **`moneymarket/src/main/java/com/example/moneymarket/service/BalanceService.java`**
   - Added `Optional` import
   - Updated `getLatestInterestAccrued()` method
   - Enhanced logging

### No Frontend Changes Required
The frontend already displays the `interestAccrued` field from the API response.

### No Database Changes Required
Uses existing `Acct_Bal_Accrual` table structure.

---

## How the Fix Works

### Data Flow

```
1. Frontend requests account details
   GET /api/accounts/customer/100000002001
   
2. CustomerAccountService.getAccountById()
   ↓
3. CustomerAccountService.mapToResponse()
   ↓
4. BalanceService.getComputedAccountBalance()
   ↓
5. BalanceService.getLatestInterestAccrued()
   ↓
6. AcctBalAccrualRepository.findLatestByAccountNo()
   ↓ (Native SQL Query)
7. Database: SELECT * FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
             WHERE Account_No = '100000002001' 
               AND Tran_date IS NOT NULL 
             ORDER BY Tran_date DESC 
             LIMIT 1
   ↓
8. Returns AcctBalAccrual entity with Closing_Bal
   ↓
9. Extract Closing_Bal value
   ↓
10. Return to frontend in API response
   ↓
11. Frontend displays in "Interest Accrued" field
```

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Database Has Data

```sql
-- Check if account has interest accrual records
SELECT 
    Accr_Bal_Id,
    Account_No,
    Tran_date,
    Accrual_Date,
    Closing_Bal,
    Interest_Amount
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001'
ORDER BY Tran_date DESC;
```

**Expected:** Should return at least one record with:
- `Tran_date` NOT NULL
- `Closing_Bal` has a value (e.g., 150.50)

### Step 2: Restart Backend

```bash
cd moneymarket
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Or restart your Spring Boot application.

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs

Look for log entries like:

```
INFO: Fetching latest interest accrued for account: 100000002001
INFO: Latest interest accrued for account 100000002001: 150.50 
      (from Tran_date: 2025-10-27, Accrual_Date: 2025-10-27)
```

Or if no records:

```
INFO: No interest accrual records found for account 100000002001 
      (with non-null Tran_date)
```

### Step 4: Test API Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:8082/api/accounts/customer/100000002001
```

**Check Response:**

```json
{
  "accountNo": "100000002001",
  "acctName": "John Doe",
  "currentBalance": 10000.00,
  "computedBalance": 11300.00,
  "interestAccrued": 150.50,    // ← Should have value from database
  "accountStatus": "ACTIVE",
  ...
}
```

### Step 5: Test Frontend

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/accounts/100000002001`
2. Check the "Interest Accrued" field
3. Should display: `৳150.50` (or the actual value from database)
4. Should NOT display: `৳0.00`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Interest Accrued Still Shows 0

#### Cause 1: Tran_date is NULL

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT Account_No, Tran_date, Closing_Bal 
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001';
```

**Solution:** Ensure Batch Job 6 (Interest Accrual Account Balance Update) sets `Tran_date` when creating records.

#### Cause 2: Closing_Bal is NULL

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT Account_No, Tran_date, Closing_Bal 
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001' 
  AND Closing_Bal IS NOT NULL;
```

**Solution:** Ensure Batch Job 6 calculates and stores `Closing_Bal` value.

#### Cause 3: No Records Exist

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001';
```

**Solution:** Run Batch Job 6 to create interest accrual records.

#### Cause 4: Backend Not Restarted

**Solution:** Restart Spring Boot application to load new code.

#### Cause 5: Frontend Cache

**Solution:** 
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Open in incognito/private window

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Account with Interest Accrual Records

**Given:** Account `100000002001` has records in `acct_bal_accrual` with `Closing_Bal = 150.50`

**When:** User navigates to `/accounts/100000002001`

**Then:** 
- Interest Accrued field displays `৳150.50`
- Backend logs show successful fetch
- API response includes `"interestAccrued": 150.50`

### Scenario 2: Account without Interest Accrual Records

**Given:** Account `100000003001` has NO records in `acct_bal_accrual`

**When:** User navigates to `/accounts/100000003001`

**Then:**
- Interest Accrued field displays `৳0.00`
- Backend logs show "No interest accrual records found"
- API response includes `"interestAccrued": 0`

### Scenario 3: Account with NULL Tran_date

**Given:** Account has records but `Tran_date` is NULL

**When:** User navigates to account page

**Then:**
- Interest Accrued field displays `৳0.00`
- Backend logs show "No interest accrual records found (with non-null Tran_date)"
- Native query filters out records with NULL `Tran_date`

### Scenario 4: Account with NULL Closing_Bal

**Given:** Account has records but `Closing_Bal` is NULL

**When:** User navigates to account page

**Then:**
- Interest Accrued field displays `৳0.00`
- Backend logs show warning about null closing balance
- Method returns `BigDecimal.ZERO`

## Debug Queries

Use these queries to debug Interest Accrued issues:

```sql
-- Query 1: Check all accrual records for account
SELECT * FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001'
ORDER BY Tran_date DESC;

-- Query 2: Get latest record (same as native query)
SELECT * FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001' 
  AND Tran_date IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY Tran_date DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Query 3: Check data quality
SELECT 
    Account_No,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Tran_date IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_tran_date,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Closing_Bal IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as null_closing_bal,
    MAX(Tran_date) as latest_tran_date,
    MAX(Closing_Bal) as max_closing_bal
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual
WHERE Account_No = '100000002001'
GROUP BY Account_No;

-- Query 4: Check if Batch Job 6 ran recently
SELECT * FROM EOD_Log_Table 
WHERE Job_Name = 'Interest Accrual Account Balance Update'
ORDER BY Start_Timestamp DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Query 5: Check all accounts with interest accruals
SELECT 
    Account_No,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    MAX(Tran_date) as latest_date,
    SUM(Closing_Bal) as total_closing_bal
FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual
GROUP BY Account_No
ORDER BY latest_date DESC;
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Fix

**Method:** Used JPA relationship-based query
```java
List<AcctBalAccrual> accruals = acctBalAccrualRepository.findByAccountAccountNo(accountNo);
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Relied on `@ManyToOne` relationship
- ❌ Could fail due to lazy loading
- ❌ Join issues could cause empty results
- ❌ Less predictable behavior

**Result:** Interest Accrued showed `0` even with database values

### After Fix

**Method:** Uses native SQL query
```java
Optional<AcctBalAccrual> latestAccrualOpt = acctBalAccrualRepository.findLatestByAccountNo(accountNo);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Direct database query
- ✅ No JPA relationship dependencies
- ✅ Predictable and reliable
- ✅ Better logging for debugging

**Result:** Interest Accrued correctly displays database values

## Related Batch Jobs

### Batch Job 6: Interest Accrual Account Balance Update

**Purpose:** Calculates and stores interest accrual balances in `acct_bal_accrual` table

**Key Fields Updated:**
- `Tran_date` - Must be set for records to be found
- `Accrual_Date` - Date of interest accrual
- `Interest_Amount` - Daily interest amount
- `Opening_Bal` - Opening balance for the day
- `DR_Summation` - Total debits
- `CR_Summation` - Total credits (interest)
- `Closing_Bal` - **This is what displays in Interest Accrued field**

**Ensure:** Batch Job 6 runs daily to keep interest accruals up-to-date.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Native Query Performance

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Acct_Bal_Accrual 
WHERE Account_No = ? 
  AND Tran_date IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY Tran_date DESC 
LIMIT 1
```

**Optimization:**
- Uses index on `Account_No` column
- `LIMIT 1` ensures only one record returned
- `Tran_date IS NOT NULL` filter is efficient

**Recommended Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_acct_bal_accrual_account_tran 
ON Acct_Bal_Accrual(Account_No, Tran_date DESC);
```
