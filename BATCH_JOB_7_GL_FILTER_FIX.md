# Batch Job 7 - Financial Reports GL Filtering Fix

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Component:** Batch Job 7 - Financial Reports Generation  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND COMPILED

---

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** Batch Job 7 (Financial Reports Generation) was including ALL GLs from the `gl_setup` table in Trial Balance and Balance Sheet reports, regardless of whether those GLs were actually being used in account creation.

**Impact:**
- Reports showed unnecessary "clutter" with unused GLs
- Made financial reports harder to read and analyze
- Included GLs that had zero balances and no activity
- Did not reflect actual business operations

---

## Root Cause

The financial report generation service was using:
```java
List<GLBalance> glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDate(reportDate);
```

This fetched **ALL** GL balances for the date, which included:
- GLs from `gl_setup` that were never linked to sub-products
- GLs that had no accounts created
- GLs that existed only in the chart of accounts structure

---

## Solution Implemented

### Business Logic

Financial reports now ONLY include GLs where:
1. The GL is linked to a sub-product (`sub_prod_master.Cum_GL_Num`)
2. OR the GL is an interest income/expenditure GL (`interest_income_expenditure_gl_num`)
3. OR the GL is an interest receivable/payable GL (`interest_receivable_payable_gl_num`)
4. AND the sub-product has at least one account created:
   - Either in `cust_acct_master` (customer accounts)
   - OR in `of_acct_master` (office accounts)

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. New Repository Method - `GLSetupRepository.java`

Added method to fetch only active GL numbers:

```java
@Query(value = """
    SELECT DISTINCT gl.GL_Num
    FROM gl_setup gl
    WHERE gl.GL_Num IN (
        -- Get GLs from sub-products that have customer accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        
        UNION
        
        -- Get GLs from sub-products that have office accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        
        UNION
        
        -- Get interest income/expenditure GLs from sub-products with customer accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.interest_income_expenditure_gl_num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        WHERE sp.interest_income_expenditure_gl_num IS NOT NULL
        
        UNION
        
        -- Get interest receivable/payable GLs from sub-products with customer accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.interest_receivable_payable_gl_num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        WHERE sp.interest_receivable_payable_gl_num IS NOT NULL
        
        UNION
        
        -- Get interest income/expenditure GLs from sub-products with office accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.interest_income_expenditure_gl_num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        WHERE sp.interest_income_expenditure_gl_num IS NOT NULL
        
        UNION
        
        -- Get interest receivable/payable GLs from sub-products with office accounts
        SELECT DISTINCT sp.interest_receivable_payable_gl_num
        FROM sub_prod_master sp
        INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
        WHERE sp.interest_receivable_payable_gl_num IS NOT NULL
    )
    ORDER BY gl.GL_Num
    """, nativeQuery = true)
List<String> findActiveGLNumbersWithAccounts();
```

#### 2. New Repository Method - `GLBalanceRepository.java`

Added method to fetch balances for specific GLs:

```java
@Query("SELECT gb FROM GLBalance gb WHERE gb.tranDate = ?1 AND gb.glNum IN ?2")
List<GLBalance> findByTranDateAndGlNumIn(LocalDate tranDate, List<String> glNumbers);
```

#### 3. Updated Service - `FinancialReportsService.java`

**Trial Balance Generation:**
```java
// Get only active GL numbers (those used in account creation through sub-products)
List<String> activeGLNumbers = glSetupRepository.findActiveGLNumbersWithAccounts();

if (activeGLNumbers.isEmpty()) {
    log.warn("No active GL numbers found with accounts");
    // Fallback to all GLs
    List<GLBalance> glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDate(reportDate);
    return generateTrialBalanceReportFromBalances(glBalances, filePath, reportDate);
}

log.info("Found {} active GL numbers with accounts", activeGLNumbers.size());

// Get GL balances only for active GLs
List<GLBalance> glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDateAndGlNumIn(reportDate, activeGLNumbers);
```

**Balance Sheet Generation:**
```java
// Get only active GL numbers
List<String> activeGLNumbers = glSetupRepository.findActiveGLNumbersWithAccounts();

List<GLBalance> glBalances;
if (activeGLNumbers.isEmpty()) {
    log.warn("No active GL numbers found with accounts, using all GLs");
    glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDate(reportDate);
} else {
    log.info("Found {} active GL numbers with accounts for Balance Sheet", activeGLNumbers.size());
    glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDateAndGlNumIn(reportDate, activeGLNumbers);
}
```

## Files Modified

### Backend (3 files)
1. ✅ `GLSetupRepository.java` - Added `findActiveGLNumbersWithAccounts()` method
2. ✅ `GLBalanceRepository.java` - Added `findByTranDateAndGlNumIn()` method
3. ✅ `FinancialReportsService.java` - Updated report generation logic

### No Frontend Changes Required
Reports are generated on the backend and downloaded as CSV files.

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Run Batch Job 7 and Verify GL Count

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/admin/eod`
2. Click "Run Job" for Batch Job 7
3. Download Trial Balance CSV
4. Count GLs in report

**Before Fix Expected:** ~150 GLs (all from gl_setup)  
**After Fix Expected:** ~12-20 GLs (only those with accounts)

**Verification Query:**
```sql
-- Count active GLs with accounts
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT gl.GL_Num) as active_gl_count
FROM gl_setup gl
WHERE gl.GL_Num IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp
    INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp
    INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
);
```

### Test 2: Verify Specific GLs Appear

**Steps:**
1. Run Batch Job 7
2. Download Trial Balance
3. Verify these GLs appear:
   - `110102001` (Customer - Current Account)
   - `110101001` (Customer - Savings)
   - `210201001` (Office - Overdraft)
   - `240101001` (Interest Receivable)
   - `130101001` (Interest Payable)

**Expected:** All listed GLs should appear in report

### Test 3: Verify Unused GLs Don't Appear

**Steps:**
1. Identify GLs from gl_setup with NO accounts
2. Run Batch Job 7
3. Search for these GLs in Trial Balance

**Expected:** These GLs should NOT appear in report

### Test 4: Create New Account and Verify GL Inclusion

**Steps:**
1. Note current GL count in report
2. Create new account with previously unused sub-product
3. Run Batch Job 7
4. Verify new GL appears in report

**Expected:** New GL should now appear after account creation

### Test 5: Balance Sheet Validation

**Steps:**
1. Run Batch Job 7
2. Download Balance Sheet
3. Verify only active GLs appear
4. Verify Balance Sheet still balances:
   - Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Net Profit/Loss

**Expected:** Balance Sheet balanced with reduced GL count

## Backend Logs to Monitor

After running Batch Job 7, check logs for:

```
INFO: Found 12 active GL numbers with accounts
INFO: Trial Balance Report generated: 12 GL accounts, Total DR=X, Total CR=X
INFO: Trial Balance validation passed: DR = CR = X
INFO: Found 12 active GL numbers with accounts for Balance Sheet
INFO: Balance Sheet validation passed: Assets = Liabilities + Net Profit/Loss
```

---

## SQL Verification Queries

### Query 1: List All Active GLs

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT gl.GL_Num, gl.GL_Name
FROM gl_setup gl
WHERE gl.GL_Num IN (
    -- Customer account GLs
    SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num
    FROM sub_prod_master sp
    INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
    
    UNION
    
    -- Office account GLs
    SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num
    FROM sub_prod_master sp
    INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
)
ORDER BY gl.GL_Num;
```

### Query 2: Count Active vs Total GLs

```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gl_setup) as total_gls,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT gl.GL_Num)
     FROM gl_setup gl
     WHERE gl.GL_Num IN (
         SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp
         INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
         UNION
         SELECT DISTINCT sp.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp
         INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
     )) as active_gls;
```

### Query 3: GLs with Account Counts

```sql
SELECT 
    gl.GL_Num,
    gl.GL_Name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ca.Account_No) as customer_accounts,
    COUNT(DISTINCT oa.Account_No) as office_accounts
FROM gl_setup gl
LEFT JOIN sub_prod_master sp ON sp.Cum_GL_Num = gl.GL_Num
LEFT JOIN cust_acct_master ca ON ca.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
LEFT JOIN of_acct_master oa ON oa.Sub_Product_Id = sp.Sub_Product_Id
WHERE gl.GL_Num IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT sp2.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp2
    INNER JOIN cust_acct_master ca2 ON ca2.Sub_Product_Id = sp2.Sub_Product_Id
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT sp2.Cum_GL_Num FROM sub_prod_master sp2
    INNER JOIN of_acct_master oa2 ON oa2.Sub_Product_Id = sp2.Sub_Product_Id
)
GROUP BY gl.GL_Num, gl.GL_Name
ORDER BY gl.GL_Num;
```

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If this change causes issues, revert with:

**1. Restore FinancialReportsService.java:**
```java
// Revert to original logic
List<GLBalance> glBalances = glBalanceRepository.findByTranDate(reportDate);
```

**2. Recompile:**
```bash
mvn clean compile -DskipTests
```

**3. Restart backend**

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Cache the list of active GLs
- Refresh cache when new accounts are created
- Add database index on `Sub_Product_Id` in both account tables

### 2. Configuration Option
- Add property to toggle between "all GLs" vs "active GLs only"
- Allow administrators to choose reporting mode

### 3. Account Status Filtering
- Consider adding filter for account status
- Options: Include only Active, or Active + Inactive, etc.

### 4. Historical Reports
- Maintain history of which GLs were active on specific dates
- Allow historical report generation with correct GL filtering
